##Project Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a regression model to estimate taxi fares in New York City before the ride, utilizing data provided by the New York City Taxi & Limousine
Commission (TLC). The project involved data exploration, analysis, and visualization using Python and Tableau. Statistical methods were employed to interpret the data, including
descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. The modeling results will be used to assist the TLC in optimizing fare estimation for taxi services.

##Business Understanding

The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) aims to enhance the efficiency and transparency of taxi services by providing accurate fare estimates to passengers. With over one
million trips per day, ensuring fair and consistent pricing is essential for customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance. By developing a regression model to estimate taxi fares
based on historical trip data, the TLC can improve pricing accuracy and reliability, thereby enhancing the overall passenger experience and facilitating fair compensation for drivers.

##Data Understanding

The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) and comprises trip data from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees. The dataset
includes various features such as trip duration, distance, pickup and drop-off locations, fare amounts, and payment methods. Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into the
distribution and relationships between different variables. Visualizations were created to illustrate key patterns and trends within the dataset, aiding in the understanding of the data
structure and potential factors influencing taxi fares.

##Modeling and Evaluation

Multiple regression models, including multiple linear regression and possibly other advanced regression techniques, were employed to predict taxi fares based on relevant trip features.
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2) will be utilized to assess the performance of the regression models.
Additionally, hypothesis testing may be conducted to analyze the significance of certain variables in determining fare amounts. The goal is to develop a reliable regression model that
accurately estimates taxi fares and provides valuable insights into fare determinants.

##Conclusion

The regression model developed in this project offers a promising solution for estimating taxi fares in New York City based on historical trip data. By leveraging statistical methods and
machine learning techniques, the TLC can improve fare estimation accuracy and enhance the overall efficiency of taxi services. Recommendations include further refining the regression
model based on additional data insights and conducting rigorous testing to validate its performance. Future steps may involve deploying the model in real-world scenarios and
incorporating feedback from stakeholders to continuously optimize fare estimation algorithms.
